Build environment
1. Get Xcode from the App Store

2. wxWidgets
- Get the latest sources of wxWidgets 3.0 from wxwidgets.org and unpack them.
- Move the unpacked directory someplace where you want to keep it.
- Apply the patches from TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets-patches (manually from within the wxWidgets directory):
  patch -p0 < ../TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets-patches/*.diff
- Open a terminal and change into the wxwidgets directory.
- Create two directories: build-release and build-debug (don't rename those!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-release
- Run 
  ../configure --with-osx_cocoa --disable-shared --with-opengl --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64 --with-macosx-version-min=10.6 --without-liblzma --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin --with-regex=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin --with-zlib=builtin --with-expat=builtin
- Run make (don't run make install!)
- Change into wxwidgets/build-debug
- Run 
  ../configure --enable-debug --with-osx_cocoa --with-opengl --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64 --with-macosx-version-min=10.6 --without-liblzma --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin --with-regex=builtin --with-libtiff=builtin --with-zlib=builtin --with-expat=builtin
- Run make, then sudo make install
- Create a link from TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets to your wxWidgets directory, e.g.
  ln -s ~/Documents/Code/wxWidgets-3.0.2 ~/Documents/Code/TrenchBroom/Mac/wxWidgets
