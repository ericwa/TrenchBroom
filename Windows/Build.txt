Build environment
1. You need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. The Express edition will work.

2. wxWidgets
- Get the binary build of wxWidgets 3.0.2 for your platform from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.2/binaries/

  - For 32bit builds, you need the following files:
    - wxWidgets-3.0.2_Headers.7z
    - wxMSW-3.0.2-vc100_Dev.7z
    - wxMSW-3.0.2_vc100_ReleaseDLL.7z
    - wxMSW-3.0.2_vc100_ReleasePDB.7z

- Unpack all files into the same directory so that "include" and "lib" directories are at the same level after unpacking.
- Set up an environment variable named "WXWIN" pointing to the directory that contains the aforementioned directories.
- Add C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\lib\vc100_dll to the "PATH" environment variable.

3. Build
Open the Visual Studio solution at Windows/TrenchBroom.sln and compile / run it!
